          Hi! My name is Dallas Lind and I'm a Software Engineer specializing in
          full stack engineering! Currently hailing from the Washington D.C.
          area, I'm a MERN stack engineer who enjoys discussing film, playing
          video games, and bottomless brunches. I recently graduated with my
          Bachelor of Arts in General Studies Focusing in Finance and Accounting
          from Southern New Hampshire and completed the Software Engineering
          Immersive Program from General Assembly in December 2019. I'm
          currently open to new opportunities!
        </p>
